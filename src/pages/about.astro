      <Title>About the Mammal Diversity Database</Title>
      <p>
        Development for this work is funded primarily by the <a
          href="http://www.mammalsociety.org/"
          >American Society of Mammalogists</a
        > (ASM; 2017-present), with initial logistical and planning support (2017-2019)
        provided by the <a href="http://vertlife.org/grant/"
          >NSF Vertlife Terrestrial grant</a
        >. Logistical support is now also provided by the <a
          href="https://biokic.asu.edu/"
          >Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center</a
        > at Arizona State University.
        <br />

        The <a href="http://www.mammalsociety.org/committees/biodiversity"
          >ASM Biodiversity Committee</a
        > compiles and maintains the Mammal Diversity Database (MDD), an updatable
        online database of mammal taxonomic and biodiversity information hosted by
        ASM at <a href="http://mammaldiversity.org/"
          >http://mammaldiversity.org/</a
        >. This database aims to provide the latest information on species-level
        and higher taxonomic changes, thereby promoting more rigorous study of
        mammalian biodiversity worldwide. The initial objective has been to
        aggregate, curate, and compile, new citations on species descriptions
        and taxonomic revisions into regular releases that are downloadable in
        comma-delimited format. Downstream goals include expanded hosting of
        ecological, trait, and taxonomic data. Overall, this initiative aims to
        promote the ASMâ€™s role as a leader in high quality research on mammalian
        biology.
